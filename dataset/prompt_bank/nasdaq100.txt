The Nasdaq-100 Index is a stock market index that comprises 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market based on market capitalization. It includes leading firms from various sectors such as technology, consumer services, healthcare, and industrials, with a heavy emphasis on innovative and high-growth companies. Prominent constituents include tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, and Alphabet. Unlike the broader Nasdaq Composite, the Nasdaq-100 excludes financial sector firms such as banks and investment companies. The index is market-cap weighted, meaning companies with larger market values have a greater influence on the index's movement.
